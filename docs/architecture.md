# Architecture of the Current Implementation

Single-process **polling orchestrator** that drives GitHub issues through a label-based state machine, delegating the actual coding work to a configurable coding-agent CLI (`codex` or `claude`) running as a subprocess in isolated git worktrees. The dev/review/decompose backends are picked independently via `DEV_AGENT` / `REVIEW_AGENT` / `DECOMPOSE_AGENT` (default: claude decomposes, claude implements, codex reviews) and validated at config load. New unlabeled issues route through a `decomposing` stage that asks the decomposer agent for a structured manifest: `decision=single` flips the issue to `ready` and the implementer takes over; `decision=split` creates child issues, persists the dep graph, and parks the parent on `blocked` (or `umbrella` when the manifest's `umbrella` flag is true — a parent with no implementation of its own that `_handle_umbrella` closes to `done` once every child resolves) until the matching handler walks the children. Once the reviewer approves and the PR is mergeable with green CI, the orchestrator can merge it itself (gated by `AUTO_MERGE`, default off) and close the issue with `done`; an approved-but-unmergeable PR detours through a `resolving_conflict` stage that auto-merges `origin/<base>` (capped by `MAX_CONFLICT_ROUNDS`) before bouncing back to `validating`; PRs closed without merge land on `rejected`. Decomposition can be disabled with `DECOMPOSE=off`, which reverts to the legacy direct-to-`implementing` pickup.

## Top-level layout

```
orchestrator/
  main.py      — entry point, polling loop, self-restart guard
  config.py    — env loading, secrets handling, backend validation
  github.py    — PyGithub wrapper, label bootstrap, pinned-state comment
  agents.py    — coding-agent subprocess runner (codex/claude dispatch)
  workflow.py  — state machine over labels
```

## Process model

There is **only one long-lived process**: `python -m orchestrator.main`. It is wrapped by `run.sh` so the loop can self-exit and be restarted with new code.

- **Trigger**: started manually (or by a wrapper). Optional `--once` for a single tick.
- **Tick cadence**: every `POLL_INTERVAL` seconds (default 60).
- **Self-restart guard** (`main._self_modifying_merge_happened`): each tick fetches `origin/<ORCHESTRATOR_BASE_BRANCH>` (default `main`); if it advanced past the process's startup SHA *and* the new commits touch `orchestrator/`, the loop exits 0 so the wrapper can re-exec the new code. The branch is decoupled from `BASE_BRANCH` so a target repo with a different default branch does not interfere with self-update detection.
- **Signals**: SIGINT/SIGTERM set a flag; the current tick finishes, then the loop exits.

The coding agent runs as a **transient child subprocess**, not a daemon — spawned per tick when work is needed.

## Per-tick flow (`workflow.tick`)

Each tick the polling loop fans out across **every configured repo**. `config.default_repo_specs()` returns a list of `RepoSpec(slug, target_root, base_branch)` — one entry per `REPOS` line, or a single entry derived from the legacy `REPO` / `TARGET_REPO_ROOT` / `BASE_BRANCH` trio when `REPOS` is unset. `main._run_tick` iterates every `(spec, gh)` pair and calls `workflow.tick(gh, spec)` once per repo; a per-repo exception is logged and swallowed so one wedged repo cannot stop the others from advancing this tick. Each `GitHubClient` is constructed once at startup with `repo_spec=spec` and `ensure_workflow_labels` runs per repo so a fresh target repo bootstraps its labels on first connect.

Inside `workflow.tick(gh, spec)`, before any issue is dispatched the tick runs `_refresh_base_and_worktrees(gh, spec)`: a single `git fetch origin <base>` in `spec.target_root`, then per-issue dispatch on each existing worktree under `<WORKTREES_DIR>/<owner>__<name>/issue-*`. The per-stage `_ensure_*_worktree` helpers only fetch base on (re)creation, so a worktree that survives across ticks would otherwise stay anchored at whatever `origin/<base>` looked like when it was first added. Two paths depending on whether a PR already exists for the issue: **pre-PR worktrees** (no `pr_number` in pinned state) get a clean-tree `git merge --no-edit origin/<base>` directly — there is no remote to push to, so a local-only merge commit is the right outcome. **PR-having worktrees** in `validating` / `in_review` are detoured to `resolving_conflict` instead (via `_route_pr_worktree_to_resolving_conflict`: post a PR notice, seed `conflict_round` only when absent, flip the label) so the existing `_handle_resolving_conflict` handler does merge + push + relabel-to-validating in one consistent flow. A local-only merge commit on a pushed branch would otherwise diverge local HEAD from `pr.head.sha` and break the validating reviewer (it reads local HEAD, so it would snapshot `agent_approved_sha` to a SHA that isn't on the PR), `_squash_and_force_push`'s `--force-with-lease=<original_head>` (the lease compares against the un-merged remote tip), and AUTO_MERGE's `agent_approved_sha == pr.head.sha` gate. The detour works under `AUTO_MERGE=off` too — `_handle_resolving_conflict` never reads AUTO_MERGE, it just does merge + push + relabel. The detour deliberately does NOT call `_bump_in_review_watermarks` (the `_handle_in_review` analog runs that AFTER scanning new comments — running it here, before any handler scans, would silently mark unread human "do not merge" / fix-request comments as consumed and AUTO_MERGE could land the PR over them). The orchestrator's own PR notice is filtered out via `orchestrator_comment_ids` on the next in_review scan, so leaving the watermark alone is safe. The detour also skips when `awaiting_human=True` because `_handle_resolving_conflict`'s awaiting-human branch returns early without merging unless a new human comment arrived; relabeling here would just hide the existing park behind a `resolving_conflict` label without progress, including the documented `AUTO_MERGE=off` unmergeable-park case. Before relabeling, the detour fetches `gh.get_pr(pr_number)` and skips when `pr_state != "open"`: a just-merged PR advances `origin/<base>`, so the still-validating / still-in_review worktree pointed at the now-stale branch is naturally behind base; without this gate the refresh would post an "auto-resolution" notice and relabel to `resolving_conflict` on a PR the next handler call would finalize to `done` (or `rejected` for a closed-without-merge PR). A `gh.get_pr` failure is treated as "leave alone" so the handler retries from a stable label rather than racing a half-known PR state. Issues already labeled `resolving_conflict` are also skipped (the handler runs this tick anyway). Merge over rebase across both paths matches `_handle_resolving_conflict`'s standing contract: rebase rewrites every commit's SHA, which would invalidate `agent_approved_sha` and force the reviewer to re-approve even when only the base content changed. Dirty worktrees (in-flight agent edits, crash-recovered trees) are skipped, and on a pre-PR content conflict the merge is aborted so the worktree stays on its pre-merge SHA. Failures are logged and swallowed; keeping every issue moving matters more than perfect base sync.

Then `gh.list_pollable_issues()` yields all open non-PR issues plus closed non-PR issues still labeled `in_review` or `resolving_conflict`. The closed-`in_review`/`resolving_conflict` sweep is what makes the manual-merge path land cleanly: a human-merged PR with a `Resolves #N` footer auto-closes issue N before the orchestrator can flip the label, and without the sweep `_handle_in_review` / `_handle_resolving_conflict` would never run on it.

For every yielded issue:

1. Read its workflow label (one of `decomposing/ready/blocked/umbrella/implementing/validating/in_review/resolving_conflict/done/rejected`).
2. Dispatch by label. The full lifecycle (no label → `decomposing` → `ready`/`blocked`/`umbrella` → `implementing` → `validating` → `in_review` → `resolving_conflict` (optional detour) → `done`/`rejected`) is implemented; `done` and `rejected` are terminal no-ops, every other label routes to its handler. Every handler receives the active `RepoSpec`, so `git worktree add`, `git fetch origin <base>`, push-token resolution (`config._resolve_github_token(spec.slug)`), and PR-base selection all flow from the spec rather than module-level `config.REPO` / `config.TARGET_REPO_ROOT` / `config.BASE_BRANCH` reads.

Per-issue durable state lives in a single **"pinned" comment** on the issue (`<!--orchestrator-state {...json...}-->`), holding `dev_agent` + `dev_session_id` (the backend that handled this issue and its session), `review_agent`, `decomposer_agent` + `decomposer_session_id` (parents only; same lock-on-first-spawn semantics as `dev_agent`), `children` (parents only — child issue numbers, used by `_handle_blocked`), `dep_graph` (parents only — `{child_idx_str: [child_idx, ...]}` because GitHub has no first-class blocks-issue relation), `decomposed_at`, `pickup_comment_id`, `branch`, `pr_number`, `review_round`, `retry_window_start` + `retry_count` (per-issue 24h fresh-spawn budget; shared between implementing and decomposing), `awaiting_human`, `last_action_comment_id`, `pr_last_comment_id` (in_review high-watermark across the issue thread + PR conversation comments, which share the IssueComment id space; seeded at validating → in_review handoff so the orchestrator's own automated comments don't replay as fresh feedback, and bumped past any park comment so an HITL ping doesn't replay either), `pr_last_review_comment_id` (separate watermark for inline PR review comments, which live in their own id space), `pr_last_review_summary_id` (separate watermark in the PullRequestReview id space, distinct from both IssueComment and PullRequestComment ids; the watermark *only* advances from review IDs that survived `gh.pr_reviews_after`'s state/body filter — non-empty `CHANGES_REQUESTED` or `COMMENTED` — so `APPROVED`, `DISMISSED`, `PENDING`, and empty-body reviews **never** bump it. `_bump_in_review_watermarks` mirrors the same filter and advances strictly from the filtered list. This is safe because the same filter runs on every scan, so an `APPROVED` review id sitting above the watermark is harmlessly re-skipped each tick rather than re-forwarded), `agent_approved_sha` (the head SHA the reviewer agent OK'd; `_handle_in_review` keys AUTO_MERGE on this since the agent posts an issue comment, not a real PR review), `merged_at` / `closed_without_merge_at` (terminal stamps), etc. (see `github.PINNED_STATE_MARKER` / `PINNED_STATE_RE` and `read_pinned_state` / `write_pinned_state`). The legacy `codex_session_id` key written before the configurable-backend rollout is still honored on read and treated as codex.

## Stage handlers

### `_handle_pickup` (no label → `decomposing` or `implementing`)
- **Trigger**: open issue with no workflow label.
- **Input**: issue title/body/comments; `config.DECOMPOSE` (default on); `config.ALLOWED_ISSUE_AUTHORS` (default empty → allow all).
- **Action**: when `ALLOWED_ISSUE_AUTHORS` is set, an issue authored by anyone outside the list is silently skipped (log only); otherwise post a "picking this up" comment, anchor `pickup_comment_id` for the in_review legacy migration, then route:
  - `DECOMPOSE=on` → label `decomposing`, fall into `_handle_decomposing`.
  - `DECOMPOSE=off` → label `implementing`, fall into `_handle_implementing` (legacy bootstrap path).

### `_handle_decomposing` (label `decomposing`)
- **Trigger**: each tick while the label is `decomposing`.
- **Input**: issue + comments + pinned state (`decomposer_agent`/`decomposer_session_id`, retry-budget keys).
- **Internal flow**:
  1. If `awaiting_human`: re-check for new human comments since `last_action_comment_id`; if any, **resume** the decomposer session via `run_agent(decomposer_agent, ...)` with that text. The backend is locked to whichever wrote `decomposer_session_id` for this issue. If no new comments, return.
  2. Otherwise: gate on the **per-issue retry budget** (shared with `implementing` — both consume the same daily counter on purpose). If exhausted, park awaiting human.
  3. Ensure a per-issue worktree (read-only — the decomposer never commits, but the agent still wants `git ls-files` / `wc -l` context).
  4. Build the **decomposer prompt** (issue body + recent comments + sizing rule of thumb + the manifest schema) and `run_agent(config.DECOMPOSE_AGENT, ...)`. On a new session id, persist `decomposer_agent` + `decomposer_session_id`.
  5. **Read-only check**: if the worktree now has new commits or dirty files, park awaiting human. The decomposer is supposed to be read-only; otherwise the implementer recovery path in `_handle_implementing` would later see the leftover commits and push decomposer-authored work as if it were implementation.
  6. Parse the manifest from `result.last_message` via `_parse_manifest` (regex captures the fenced ` ```orchestrator-manifest ` block; structural validation rejects unknown decisions, bad child shape, self-deps, cycles, and >10 children):
     - **invalid manifest** → park awaiting human with the parse error and the agent's last message quoted (same recovery as a malformed reviewer verdict).
     - **no fenced block** → treat as a question; park with the message quoted (mirrors `_on_question` from implementing).
     - **decision == "single"** → post a one-line "fits in one context" comment with the rationale, set label `ready`, stamp `decomposed_at`. `_handle_ready` picks it up next tick.
     - **decision == "split"** → crash-safe creation in three phases. (a) For each child call `gh.create_child_issue(...)` (which prepends `Parent: #<n>` to the body, no auto-close keyword) with label `blocked` regardless of dependencies, and seed the child's pinned state with `parent_number`; child-state seeding is mandatory — failure persists the partial `children` list and parks awaiting human (no orphan child is left runnable). (b) Persist `children`, `dep_graph` (`{child_idx_str: [child_idx, ...]}`), and `umbrella` (from the manifest's optional boolean, default false) on the parent, post the summary comment, set parent label `umbrella` when the flag is true and otherwise `blocked`, stamp `decomposed_at`. (c) Activate no-dep children by flipping their label `blocked` → `ready`; this is best-effort because `_handle_blocked`'s / `_handle_umbrella`'s walk also treats no-dep children as deps-satisfied, so a crashed activation step is recovered on the next tick.
- **Pre-flight (half-finished recovery)**: if `children` is already set on the parent but the label is still `decomposing`, a prior tick crashed between child creation and the parent label flip. Re-running the decomposer would create duplicates, so the handler short-circuits: when not awaiting_human, flip the parent to `umbrella` (when the persisted `umbrella` flag is true) or `blocked` and let the matching handler activate children; when awaiting_human (parent state was parked mid-creation), hold and require manual intervention.
- **Pre-flight (DECOMPOSE kill switch, mid-flight)**: if `config.DECOMPOSE` is off when this handler runs (operator restarted with the rollout disabled while the issue was already labeled `decomposing` or parked there), bail out before any decomposer spawn: post a routing comment, clear the decomposer-side `awaiting_human`/`park_reason` so the legacy implementing flow doesn't trip its resume branch on stale state, flip the label to `implementing`, and fall into `_handle_implementing`. The half-finished recovery above runs first and is unaffected — abandoning orphan children that already exist on GitHub just because new decompositions are now disabled is not what a kill switch should do.
- **Output**: parent label moved to `ready` / `blocked` / `umbrella`, OR a HITL park.

### `_handle_ready` (label `ready` → `implementing`)
- **Trigger**: each tick while the label is `ready`. Reached by either a `single`-decision parent or by a freshly-created child.
- **Action**: if `pickup_comment_id` is unset (the common path for auto-created children), post a "picking this up; starting implementation" comment and seed `created_at` + `pickup_comment_id` so the in_review legacy migration has its anchor. Bump `last_action_comment_id` to the latest visible comment id (one-way ratchet) so any human comments posted while the parent was `decomposing` / `blocked` are marked consumed — the implementer reads them at spawn via `_recent_comments_text`, so they must NOT later resurface as fresh PR feedback in `_handle_in_review`'s watermark seed (which would bounce the PR back to validating after merge readiness). Then flip the label to `implementing` and fall through into `_handle_implementing` on the same tick.

### `_handle_blocked` (label `blocked`)
- **Trigger**: each tick while the label is `blocked`.
- **Input**: pinned `children` (parent only), optional `dep_graph` (parent only — `{child_idx_str: [child_idx, ...]}`), `parent_number` (child only — seeded by the decomposer at child-creation time).
- **Internal flow**:
  1. If no `children` recorded but `parent_number` is set → no-op. The parent's `_handle_blocked` walks the dep graph and flips this child to `ready` when its dependencies finish; this tick has nothing to do.
  2. If no `children` and no `parent_number` (manual relabel suspected), park awaiting human.
  3. Read each child's current workflow label via `gh.get_issue(n)` + `gh.workflow_label(child)`.
  4. If any child is `rejected` → park parent awaiting human (the human decides whether to re-decompose or close).
  5. If any child is closed (`state=="closed"`) but its label is not `done`, `rejected`, or `in_review` → park parent awaiting human. A child closed manually (e.g. via the GitHub UI) before reaching `in_review` is invisible to `list_pollable_issues` (which only sweeps closed-but-`in_review` for the externally-merged path), so its workflow label stays frozen and the parent would otherwise wait forever for it. `in_review` is intentionally excluded — the closed-`in_review` sweep finalizes that transient on the next tick.
  6. If every child is `done` → post a summary comment, flip parent → `ready`. The next tick `_handle_ready` picks it up and the implementer takes over.
  7. Otherwise walk children: any `blocked` child whose recorded dependencies are all `done` gets relabeled `ready`. A child with no recorded deps is also flipped (vacuous all-done over an empty list) — this recovers no-dep children that the decomposer's same-tick activation step left as `blocked`. This walk both unblocks middle-of-the-graph children and rescues stuck activations without waiting on the parent.
- **Output**: parent → `ready` (all done), OR a sibling unblocked, OR a HITL park (rejected child, manually-closed child, or unattributed `blocked`), OR a no-op for a child still waiting on its dependencies.

### `_handle_umbrella` (label `umbrella`)
- **Trigger**: each tick while the label is `umbrella` (only ever a parent — set by the decomposer when the manifest's `umbrella` boolean is true).
- **Input**: pinned `children` and optional `dep_graph` on the parent.
- **Internal flow**: mirrors `_handle_blocked` for the rejected / manually-closed checks and the dep-graph activation walk; the only difference is the all-done terminal. An umbrella parent has no implementation work of its own — its purpose is purely aggregation — so when every child reaches `done`, the handler posts a checkmark comment, stamps `umbrella_resolved_at`, sets label `done`, and closes the issue (no flip back through `ready`/`implementing`). A `children`-less umbrella is treated as corrupt state and parks awaiting human.
- **Output**: terminal `done` (all children resolved, issue closed), OR a sibling unblocked, OR a HITL park, OR a no-op.

### `_handle_implementing` (label `implementing`)
- **Trigger**: each tick while the label is `implementing`.
- **Input**: issue + comments + pinned state (`dev_agent`/`dev_session_id`, retry-budget keys, etc.).
- **Internal flow**:
  1. If `awaiting_human`: re-check for new human comments since `last_action_comment_id`; if any, **resume** the dev session via `run_agent(dev_agent, ...)` with that text. The backend is locked to whichever wrote `dev_session_id` (or the legacy `codex_session_id`) for this issue — flipping `DEV_AGENT` does not migrate in-flight issues. If no new comments, return.
  2. Otherwise: ensure a per-issue worktree at `<WORKTREES_DIR>/<owner>__<name>/issue-<n>` (the slug subdir keeps two repos with the same issue number isolated on disk) on branch `orchestrator/issue-<n>`. Worktrees with unpushed commits are reused (crash recovery); otherwise force-removed and recreated from `origin/<spec.base_branch>` in `spec.target_root`.
  3. If the worktree already has commits (recovered), skip the agent and go straight to push.
  4. Else gate the run on the **per-issue retry budget** (`MAX_RETRIES_PER_DAY`, default 3): a 24h window opens at the first counted spawn and resets after 24h; only fresh spawns count, not human-resume runs or recovered-worktree pushes. If the cap is exhausted, park awaiting human and return.
  5. Else build the **implementer prompt** (issue body + recent comments + "commit, do not push") and `run_agent(config.DEV_AGENT, ...)`. On a new session id, persist `dev_agent` + `dev_session_id`.
  6. Branch on result:
     - `timed_out` → park awaiting human (`@HITL_HANDLE`).
     - new commits + clean tree → `_on_commits`: push branch, open PR (or reuse an existing open one), comment `:sparkles: PR opened: #N`, set label `validating`, reset `review_round=0` and `retry_count=0` (next bounce back into implementing starts fresh).
     - new commits + dirty files → `_on_dirty_worktree`: park; refuse to publish a partial branch.
     - no new commits → `_on_question`: post the agent's last message as a HITL question, park.
- **Output**: a pushed branch + open PR + label moved to `validating`, OR a HITL park.

### `_handle_validating` (label `validating`)
- **Trigger**: each tick while label is `validating` (set after PR opens).
- **Input**: PR #, branch, `dev_agent`/`dev_session_id` (or legacy `codex_session_id`), pinned state, `review_round`.
- **Internal flow**:
  1. Awaiting-human path: same resume mechanic as implementing (resume on the dev's locked backend); on a successful pushed fix, bump `review_round` and stay in `validating` so the reviewer runs next tick.
  2. If `review_round >= MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS` (default 3), park awaiting human.
  3. Otherwise spawn a **fresh reviewer session** via `run_agent(config.REVIEW_AGENT, ...)` with the **reviewer prompt** (read-only: `git log` / `git diff origin/<spec.base_branch>...HEAD`, must end with `VERDICT: APPROVED` or `VERDICT: CHANGES_REQUESTED`); persist `review_agent` for traceability.
  4. Parse last `VERDICT:` marker (`_parse_review_verdict`):
     - `approved` → in this order: (a) post `:white_check_mark: codex review approved.` on the PR (so the comment exists even when squash later fails); (b) when `SQUASH_ON_APPROVAL` is on (default), call `_squash_and_force_push` to collapse the dev's commits into one (subject reuses the first commit when already conventional-commit-shaped, otherwise `feat: <issue title>`; body lists the original subjects; pushed with `--force-with-lease` against the pre-squash SHA). On squash or force-push failure, **park awaiting human and stay on `validating`** (no relabel) so the original commits remain on the branch for manual triage — the approval comment has already landed on the PR. (c) On success, if `squashed_count > 1` post `:package: squashed N commits to 1 after approval` to the PR before seeding the in_review watermarks, so the seed walks past it. (d) Snapshot `agent_approved_sha` from the **local SHA the reviewer (or the squash) produced** — explicitly *not* the current remote PR head; if the remote moves out from under us, `agent_approved_sha != pr.head.sha` in the auto-merge gate and AUTO_MERGE waits for a fresh review round. With `SQUASH_ON_APPROVAL=off`, the snapshot is the pre-review local HEAD (`reviewed_sha` captured before `run_agent`). (e) Seed the in_review comment watermarks, then set label `in_review`.
     - `unknown` (no marker) → park.
     - `changes_requested` → post the feedback to the PR, then **resume the developer's session** on its locked backend with the fix prompt; if it produces a new commit on a clean tree, push and increment `review_round` for next tick.
- **Output**: label moved to `in_review` (approval, squash succeeded or disabled) OR a new fix commit + bumped round OR a HITL park (squash/force-push failure stays on `validating` with the approval comment already on the PR; every other park branch keeps the existing label).

### `_handle_in_review` (label `in_review`)
- **Trigger**: each tick while label is `in_review` (set by `_handle_validating` after `VERDICT: APPROVED`). Also runs on closed-`in_review` issues yielded by the closed-issue sweep, so an external manual merge gets finalized to `done` even when `Resolves #N` already closed the issue.
- **Input**: pinned `pr_number`, `branch`, `dev_agent`/`dev_session_id` (or legacy `codex_session_id`), and three watermarks — one per id namespace GitHub uses for PR feedback: `pr_last_comment_id` (issue thread + PR conversation, shared IssueComment id space; falls back to `last_action_comment_id` for back-compat), `pr_last_review_comment_id` (inline review comments, PullRequestComment id space), and `pr_last_review_summary_id` (PR review summaries in the PullRequestReview id space; only the *bodies* of non-empty `CHANGES_REQUESTED` or `COMMENTED` reviews are forwarded to the dev, and only those review IDs ever advance this watermark — `APPROVED`, `DISMISSED`, `PENDING`, and empty-body reviews are filtered out by `gh.pr_reviews_after` *before* the id watermark is applied, and `_bump_in_review_watermarks` mirrors the same filter, so excluded review IDs never enter the candidate set. Re-scanning is harmless: the filter runs each tick, so an `APPROVED` id above the watermark is silently re-skipped rather than re-forwarded). Mixing any two namespaces under one watermark would silently drop or replay one side.
- **Internal flow**:
  1. If `pr_number` is missing (manual relabel suspected), park awaiting human and return; subsequent ticks no-op until the human relabels.
  2. Read the PR via `gh.get_pr`. Branch on `gh.pr_state(pr)`:
     - `merged` → set label `done`, stamp `merged_at`, write pinned state, then `issue.edit(state="closed")`. (Pinned-state write before close so PyGithub caching cannot serve a stale issue body to the writer.)
     - `closed` (without merge) → set label `rejected`, stamp `closed_without_merge_at`, write state, close.
     - `open` → fall through.
  3. **PR-comment debounce → dev resume → bounce back to validating.** Read four sources independently, one per id namespace: `gh.comments_after(issue, pr_last_comment_id)` (issue thread), `gh.pr_conversation_comments_after(pr, pr_last_comment_id)` (PR conversation; shares id space with the issue thread, so one watermark suffices), `gh.pr_inline_comments_after(pr, pr_last_review_comment_id)` (inline review comments), and `gh.pr_reviews_after(pr, pr_last_review_summary_id)` (PR review summary bodies submitted with `CHANGES_REQUESTED` or `COMMENTED` — `APPROVED` bodies are filtered out as informational, dismissed/pending never count, empty bodies are dropped). Without the `pr_reviews_after` surface, a "Comment" review with a request in the body would be silently ignored (and may be auto-merged over), and a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review with body but no inline comments would block merge via `pr_has_changes_requested` without ever reaching the dev agent. If any source is newer than its watermark and the most recent one is older than `IN_REVIEW_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS` (default 600s, matches the debounce documented in `docs/workflow.md`'s Acceptance section), build a follow-up prompt that quotes them and call `_resume_dev_with_text` on the dev's locked backend. On a successful pushed commit (clean tree + push ok), bump each watermark to the newest seen in its own id space, reset `review_round=0`, and flip the label back to `validating` so the reviewer agent re-runs on the new diff next tick. If still inside the debounce window, return — the human may still be typing.
  4. **Auto-merge gate** (only reached when there are no new comments to act on). Off unless `AUTO_MERGE=on`. Sequence: **standing CHANGES_REQUESTED veto** — `gh.pr_has_changes_requested(pr, head_sha=head_sha)` runs *before* the approval check and silently returns on True, so a human `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review on the current head SHA blocks merge even when `agent_approved_sha == head_sha`, the PR is mergeable, and checks are green (the agent's APPROVED would otherwise short-circuit `pr_is_approved`); approval check (either `agent_approved_sha == pr.head.sha`, snapshotted by validating when the reviewer agent emitted `VERDICT: APPROVED`, OR `gh.pr_is_approved(pr, head_sha=pr.head.sha)` — only counts human/bot reviews submitted on the *current* head SHA, so a stale APPROVED from before a later push does not unlock auto-merge); `pr_is_mergeable` (`None` means GitHub still computing — try next tick; `False` with `AUTO_MERGE=on` does NOT park anymore — it routes the issue to the new `resolving_conflict` stage (post a notice on the PR, seed `conflict_round=0` only when absent so a re-entry preserves the cap counter, flip the label, return), where `_handle_resolving_conflict` attempts the auto-merge of `origin/<base>` on the next tick. Under `AUTO_MERGE=off` the legacy unmergeable park still fires here); `pr_combined_check_state` (`success` proceeds; `pending` waits; `failure`/`none` parks awaiting human — `none` means no checks at all, ambiguous). Finally `gh.merge_pr(pr, sha=head_sha)` — pinned to the *captured* `head_sha` from the start of the gate sequence, **not** `pr.head.sha`. `pr_is_mergeable` calls `pr.update()` to resolve a `None` mergeable, which can refresh `pr.head.sha`; the explicit `head_sha` pin (combined with the earlier `pr.head.sha != head_sha` bail) ensures a commit landing during the refresh either bails the tick or causes GitHub to return 409/422 rather than merge an unreviewed head. PyGithub's 405/409/422 are returned as `False` and the next tick retries.
  5. On a successful merge, set label `done`, stamp `merged_at`, write pinned state, close the issue, then call `_cleanup_merged_branch` (best-effort: remove the per-issue worktree, delete the local branch, and call `gh.delete_remote_branch`). The cleanup is also run on the external-merge terminal so a human-merged PR does not leave a stale branch on the remote.
  6. Every park inside this handler bumps the in_review watermarks past the orchestrator's own park comment via `_bump_in_review_watermarks`, so the next tick does not see the HITL ping as fresh PR feedback and resume the dev agent against it.
- **Output**: label moved to `done` / `rejected` (terminal) OR a fix push and label bounce to `validating` OR a relabel to `resolving_conflict` (under `AUTO_MERGE=on` when the PR is unmergeable past the approval gates) OR a HITL park OR a no-op tick.

The "back to validating on a new PR comment" arc is intentional: validating is the stage that re-runs the reviewer after a fix is pushed. Staying in `in_review` would skip the automated re-review and rely on humans alone, contradicting the validating loop. `_park_awaiting_human` posts on the issue (not the PR) so the HITL ping appears alongside the rest of orchestrator state. The PR comment that triggers a resume is the human signal; awaiting-human is reserved for *unrecoverable* states (failed checks / push fail / missing pr_number — note: under `AUTO_MERGE=on` "not mergeable" detours to `resolving_conflict` instead of parking).

### `_handle_resolving_conflict` (label `resolving_conflict`)
- **Trigger**: each tick while label is `resolving_conflict` (set by `_handle_in_review`'s auto-merge gate when an approved PR is unmergeable under `AUTO_MERGE=on`). Also runs on closed-`resolving_conflict` issues yielded by the closed-issue sweep, mirroring the in_review terminal handling so a manually-merged PR finalizes to `done` even when `Resolves #N` already closed the issue.
- **Input**: pinned `pr_number`, `branch`, `dev_agent`/`dev_session_id` (or legacy `codex_session_id`), `conflict_round`. `MAX_CONFLICT_ROUNDS` from config.
- **Internal flow**:
  1. If `pr_number` is missing (manual relabel suspected), park awaiting human and return.
  2. Read the PR via `gh.get_pr`. Branch on `gh.pr_state(pr)`: `merged` → `done` (close issue, stamp `merged_at`, clean up the merged branch); `closed` (without merge) → `rejected` (close issue, stamp `closed_without_merge_at`); `open` → fall through. Mirrors the in_review terminal arcs for the case where a human resolves manually mid-stage.
  3. If the issue itself was closed manually while the PR is still open, treat as a hard human stop: flip to `rejected` rather than continuing to spawn the dev agent.
  4. **Awaiting-human resume path**: when parked from a previous round and a new human comment has arrived since `last_action_comment_id`, resume the dev session on the in-progress merge worktree with the human's text (mirrors `_handle_implementing`'s awaiting-human branch — the park messages explicitly invite that flow). The post-agent step uses the same `_post_conflict_resolution_result` helper as the fresh-merge path.
  5. **Cap check**: if `conflict_round >= MAX_CONFLICT_ROUNDS`, park awaiting human with the round count and the cap quoted. To escape the park the human must either (a) relabel the issue back to `validating` (or any other workflow label) so the dispatcher leaves `_handle_resolving_conflict` entirely, or (b) post a new issue comment, which the awaiting-human resume branch (item 4) picks up to drive another dev-agent round. A bare branch push or manual rebase alone does NOT unpark — `awaiting_human` stays set and step 4 returns until a comment lands or the label changes.
  6. Ensure the per-issue worktree. `_ensure_pr_worktree` (PR-aware, restores from `origin/<branch>`) is used in place of `_ensure_worktree`, which would rebuild from `origin/<base>` and silently discard the PR's commits.
  7. Refresh `origin/<branch>` over `_authed_fetch` (the same hardened authenticated channel `_push_branch` uses); a stale local `origin/<branch>` would mis-classify a real "remote moved out from under us" situation as in-sync.
  8. Compare HEAD to the freshly-fetched `origin/<branch>`. `behind > 0` (worktree diverged) → park: force-pushing local state would clobber the real PR head. `ahead > 0` (recovered unpushed commits from a previous tick that crashed before `_push_branch` returned) → run the same dirty-tree check `_on_dirty_worktree` uses, then push the recovered work and flip to `validating` with `review_round=0`, `conflict_round += 1`. `(0, 0)` (in sync) → fall through.
  9. Refresh `origin/<base>` over the same hardened path, then run `git merge --no-edit origin/<base>` in the worktree under `_git_hardened` (drops global/system git config and disables hooks/fsmonitor/credential helpers — the agent owns the worktree and could otherwise plant a hook to execute attacker code mid-merge).
  10. **Clean merge succeeded**: dirty-tree check first (a leftover edit from a crashed prior tick must not silently survive into validating). If the HEAD SHA did not move (already up-to-date — `git merge` returned success without applying anything), skip the push and flip to `validating` with `review_round=0`, `conflict_round += 1`; counting the no-op against the cap surfaces a perpetually-unmergeable-due-to-branch-protection PR within `MAX_CONFLICT_ROUNDS` ticks instead of letting it ping-pong between handlers forever. If HEAD moved (whether by fast-forward or by a real merge commit), push and flip to `validating` (same state writes).
  11. **Conflicted merge**: build a conflict-resolution prompt via `_build_conflict_resolution_prompt` (lists up to 20 conflicted paths, instructs the agent to commit the merge and not push), resume the dev session on the locked backend with that prompt, then run `_post_conflict_resolution_result`.
  12. `_post_conflict_resolution_result` is the shared post-agent funnel: timeout → park (HITL); no new commit → `_on_question` park; dirty tree → `_on_dirty_worktree` park; push fail → park; success → push, set `last_conflict_resolved_at`, increment `conflict_round`, reset `review_round=0`, flip back to `validating`. The counter increments only on the success path so a timeout/dirty/push-fail does not eat a slot from the cap.
- **Output**: label moved to `validating` (clean push or up-to-date base) OR `done`/`rejected` (terminal arcs) OR a HITL park (cap exhausted, dirty worktree, push fail, agent timeout, agent silence, fetch fail, diverged worktree, missing pr_number).

Merge over rebase by design: rebase rewrites every commit's SHA, which would invalidate the stored `agent_approved_sha` snapshot and force the reviewer agent to re-approve the entire branch even when only the base content changed. A merge commit costs one extra entry in `git log` and keeps approvals stable.

## Agent subprocess (`agents.run_agent`)

`run_agent(backend, prompt, cwd, ...)` dispatches to the per-backend runner (`_run_codex` / `_run_claude`); `backend` is one of `"codex"` / `"claude"` and is re-validated at call time so a misuse fails loudly. Both runners return a unified `AgentResult(session_id, last_message, exit_code, timed_out, stdout, stderr)`. `CodexResult` is kept as a transitional alias for one release.

- **Trigger**: called by handlers with a backend name + prompt + worktree path.
- **Codex command**: `codex exec [-C cwd | resume <sid>] --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --json -o <tempfile> <prompt>`. The `-o` path is a per-spawn `tempfile.mkstemp` outside the worktree (so target repos without `.codex-*` in `.gitignore` don't see it as untracked); `last_message` is read from it and the tempfile is unlinked in a `finally` block.
- **Claude command**: `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages --verbose <prompt>` (with `--resume <sid>` when resuming). `last_message` is parsed from the stream-json: prefers the terminal `{"type":"result","result":...}` event, falls back to the last `assistant`/`message` text content for schema-drift forward-compat.
- **Input**: prompt string; optional resume session id; timeout (`AGENT_TIMEOUT`/`REVIEW_TIMEOUT`).
- **Environment**:
  - GitHub-token-bearing env vars are stripped (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, etc.) so a prompt-injected agent cannot push or call the GitHub API. Provider auth (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, OpenAI keychain, etc.) is intentionally left intact — that is how the agent reaches its own model.
  - `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`/`GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`/`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` are injected from `AGENT_GIT_NAME`/`AGENT_GIT_EMAIL` (default `agent-orchestrator <agent-orchestrator@users.noreply.github.com>`) so agent commits are stamped with the orchestrator's identity, regardless of the host's `~/.gitconfig`.
- **Output**: `AgentResult(...)`. `session_id` is harvested by walking the JSONL events for any UUID-shaped value at `session_id`/`conversation_id`/etc. (shared between both backends).

## Push path (`workflow._push_branch`)

The orchestrator (not the agent) pushes. The push is hardened against the agent-controlled worktree:
- Token delivered via `GIT_ASKPASS` tempfile, never argv.
- Detaches from `~/.gitconfig` and `/etc/gitconfig` (`GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null`, `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null`).
- Disables `core.hooksPath`, `credential.helper`, `core.fsmonitor`.
- Refuses to push if the worktree's local config has any `url.*.insteadOf`/`pushInsteadOf` rewrite.
- Pushes via explicit refspec `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>` (no upstream stored).

## Summary of "what runs when"

| Component | Type | Trigger | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main` polling loop | long-lived Python process | manual start (or wrapper) | every `POLL_INTERVAL`s |
| `workflow.tick(gh, spec)` | function call | each loop iteration | once per tick **per configured `RepoSpec`** (single-repo legacy mode collapses to N=1) |
| `_refresh_base_and_worktrees(gh, spec)` | function call | start of each `workflow.tick` | once per tick per repo (one `git fetch origin <base>`, then per-worktree dispatch: pre-PR worktrees get a clean-tree `git merge --no-edit origin/<base>` directly; PR-having `validating`/`in_review` worktrees that are behind base detour to `resolving_conflict` so the handler does merge + push + relabel — but only when the PR is still open (a merged/closed PR is left to its terminal handler since a just-merged PR naturally advances base), skip when `awaiting_human=True` to keep the park visible, and never bump in_review watermarks here so unread human comments stay in the unread queue; conflicts abort, dirty trees skip) |
| `_handle_*` per issue | function call | issue's workflow label | once per tick per open issue (within its repo's `tick`) |
| decomposer agent (`DECOMPOSE_AGENT`) | subprocess (fresh or resumed, locked backend) | `_handle_decomposing` (retry budget OK) or HITL resume | one shot per tick when needed |
| implementer agent (`DEV_AGENT`) | subprocess | `_handle_implementing` (no commits yet, retry budget OK) or HITL resume | one shot per tick when needed |
| reviewer agent (`REVIEW_AGENT`) | subprocess (fresh session) | `_handle_validating`, round < max | one shot per tick |
| dev-fix agent | subprocess (resumed dev session, locked backend) | reviewer says CHANGES_REQUESTED | one shot per tick |
| `_handle_resolving_conflict` | function call | issue label `resolving_conflict` (set by `_handle_in_review` when an approved PR is unmergeable under `AUTO_MERGE=on`); also fires on closed-`resolving_conflict` issues from the polling sweep | once per tick per such issue (drives PR-state terminals → `done`/`rejected`, ahead-of-remote recovery push, `git merge origin/<base>` then clean-merge no-op flip / clean-merge push / dev-conflict resume / cap-park, plus all park branches) |
| dev-conflict agent | subprocess (resumed dev session, locked backend) | `_handle_resolving_conflict` and `git merge origin/<base>` left conflicts | one shot per tick |
| `git push` | subprocess | after dev produces clean commits | per fix |
| self-restart check | git fetch + diff | start of each tick | every tick |

### Roles in one line

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **main.py** | polling loop + signal handling + self-restart |
| **workflow.py** | label-driven state machine, agent orchestration, push/PR |
| **agents.py** | dispatch + spawn codex/claude subprocess, capture session id + last message |
| **github.py** | issues, comments, labels, pinned state, PR open/comment |
| **config.py** | env + token loading (token kept outside REPO_ROOT), backend validation |
| **codex / claude** | the only things that write code; run in isolated worktree |
