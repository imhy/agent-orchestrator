"""User-content drift helpers shared by stage handlers.

The orchestrator keeps a SHA-256 hash of the issue's user-visible content
(title + body + human-authored comments) in pinned state so future ticks
can detect a human edit mid-flight and react -- either by re-routing the
issue back to `decomposing` (pre-implementation stages) or by resuming
the in-flight dev session with the updated context.

This module exposes:

* `_compute_user_content_hash` -- the canonical hash over title/body/comments.
* `_detect_user_content_change` -- diff against the stored baseline, with
  durable persistence on first encounter.
* `_build_user_content_change_prompt` -- the dev-resume prompt for the
  in-flight-edit path.
* `_mark_drift_comments_consumed` -- watermark advance after the dev has
  been fed the full thread.
* `_route_drift_to_decomposing` -- destructive re-route used by the
  pre-implementation drift path.

Stage handlers live under `orchestrator/stages/` (decomposition.py,
implementing.py, documenting.py, validating.py, in_review.py, fixing.py,
conflicts.py, question.py); they reach these helpers through the
compatibility facade in `workflow.py`, which re-exports each name
above for backward compatibility with direct test references and
`patch.object(workflow, ...)` patches.

    Used by `_detect_user_content_change` so the orchestrator can react
    when a human edits the issue body or adds acceptance criteria after
    the workflow has already picked it up. Non-human content is filtered
    four ways:

    * pinned-state comment by `PINNED_STATE_MARKER`;
    * orchestrator-posted comments by `_ORCH_COMMENT_MARKER` embedded in
      the body (id-cap-resistant -- the marker stays on the GitHub side
      forever even after the comment's id has been evicted from
      `orchestrator_comment_ids`);
    * legacy orchestrator comments (posted before the marker was
      introduced) by id from `orchestrator_comment_ids`;
    * third-party Bot / App accounts (Dependabot, Renovate, CI bots, ...)
      by GitHub's `user.type == "Bot"` flag. These accounts cannot be
      filtered by the id-list or marker because we never post them, and
      they post structurally (e.g. weekly Dependabot bumps) which would
      otherwise re-trigger drift detection on every tick they post.

    Author-login matching is deliberately avoided because the orchestrator
    PAT is often shared with a human reviewer's GitHub account; a login
    filter would falsely drop the human's real review comments. The
    `user.type` flag is a structural GitHub-account property and does not
    conflict with that constraint.
