def _push_branch(

    *,
    force_with_lease: Optional[str] = None,
) -> bool:
    """Push via GIT_ASKPASS so the token never appears in argv.

    `force_with_lease`, when provided, is the SHA the caller expects the
    remote ref to be at. The push then uses
    `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<branch>:<sha>` against that exact SHA,
    so a concurrent update to the remote rejects the push instead of being
    silently clobbered. This is the squash/rewrite path: pinning the lease
    to the caller-supplied pre-rewrite HEAD (rather than reading it from
    the live remote) prevents the "out-of-band update happened in the
    window between approval and push" race -- a fresh `ls-remote` would
    treat the unexpected new remote SHA as the lease value and silently
    overwrite it.

    When `force_with_lease` is None (the default), the function reads the
    current remote SHA via `ls-remote` and uses that as the lease. This is
    the normal-push path: the orchestrator owns the
    `orchestrator/issue-<n>` namespace, but a self-restart between commit
    and push can leave the worktree on a different SHA than what was
    already pushed -- e.g. a `resume=False` rerun of codex amending
    equivalent work. A plain push then fails non-fast-forward and parks
    the issue. The lease lets the retry succeed while still refusing to
    clobber a concurrent foreign update (the lease check compares against
    what we observed, not a stale remote-tracking ref).

    The push target URL carries only the username (`x-access-token`); the
    token itself is read from the GIT_TOKEN env var by a tempfile askpass
    script. This keeps the PAT out of `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, which is
    world-readable on Linux. We also use an explicit `HEAD:refs/heads/<branch>`
    refspec so no upstream is set and no remote URL is stored in .git/config.

    The worktree is shared with the codex agent, so anything in `.git/hooks/`
    or `.git/config` is attacker-controlled. The agent also writes as the same
    OS user, so it can plant `~/.gitconfig` (or anything pointed at by
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME) before we push. We harden the push so a planted pre-push
    hook, credential helper, fsmonitor, or url-rewrite rule cannot observe
    GIT_TOKEN or redirect the push to an attacker-controlled host:
      * `core.hooksPath=/dev/null` disables `.git/hooks/*` and any hooksPath
        override the agent set in the local config.
      * `credential.helper=` (empty) clears all inherited credential helpers
        so a repo-local helper script never executes with GIT_TOKEN in env.
      * `core.fsmonitor=` disables any fsmonitor program git would otherwise
        spawn for index-touching operations.
      * `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM=/dev/null` block
        global/system config entirely, so url.<host>.insteadOf or
        pushInsteadOf rules planted in `~/.gitconfig` (or `/etc/gitconfig`)
        cannot rewrite our auth URL and exfiltrate the askpass token.
      * We also refuse to push if the local config contains any url
        insteadOf/pushInsteadOf rewrite, since those rewrite our auth URL
        and would deliver the token to whatever host the agent picked.

def _refresh_base_and_worktrees(gh: GitHubClient, spec: RepoSpec) -> None:
    """Fetch `origin/<base>` once for the spec and bring every existing
    per-issue worktree up to date.

    Runs at the start of each tick so a base-branch update on the remote
    propagates into in-flight issue worktrees without waiting for an
    AUTO_MERGE mergeability check. The per-stage `_ensure_*_worktree`
    helpers only fetch base on (re)creation, so a worktree that survives
    across ticks would otherwise stay anchored at whatever `origin/<base>`
    looked like when it was first added.

    Two paths depending on whether a PR already exists for the issue:

    * **Pre-PR worktrees** (no `pr_number` in pinned state): merge
      `origin/<base>` directly into the local worktree -- no remote yet,
      so a local-only merge commit is the right outcome and there is
      nothing to push.

    * **PR-having worktrees** (validating / in_review): merging locally
      WITHOUT pushing would diverge local HEAD from `pr.head.sha` and
      break the validating reviewer (it reads local HEAD, so it would
      snapshot `agent_approved_sha` to a SHA that isn't on the PR),
      `_squash_and_force_push`'s `--force-with-lease=<original_head>`
      (the lease compares against the un-merged remote tip), and
      AUTO_MERGE's `agent_approved_sha == pr.head.sha` gate. So instead
      we route the issue to `resolving_conflict`: the existing handler
      does the merge, pushes, and flips back to `validating` so the
      reviewer re-runs on the merged head. This works under
      `AUTO_MERGE=off` too -- `_handle_resolving_conflict` never reads
      AUTO_MERGE, it just does the merge+push+relabel cycle. Issues
      already labeled `resolving_conflict` are left alone (the handler
      runs this tick anyway); other labels are skipped (no PR worktree
      to refresh in those states).

    Merge over rebase is the codebase's standing contract (see
    `_handle_resolving_conflict`'s docstring): rebase rewrites every
    commit's SHA, which would invalidate any stored `agent_approved_sha`
    in surprising ways and force the reviewer to re-approve the entire
    branch even when only the base content changed.

    Conflicts on the pre-PR path abort the merge so the worktree stays
    on its original SHA -- conflict resolution still belongs to
    `_handle_resolving_conflict`. Dirty worktrees are skipped so a
    crash-recovered tree with uncommitted edits is never disturbed
    (mirrors `_on_dirty_worktree`'s rule). All failures are logged at
    info/warning and swallowed: keeping every issue moving matters more
    than perfect base sync.

    """Flip a behind-base PR-having issue to `resolving_conflict`.

    Mirrors `_handle_in_review`'s unmergeable detour, just driven by a
    base advance instead of a PyGithub `mergeable=False`. The handler
    then runs `git merge origin/<base>` in the worktree, pushes, and
    relabels to `validating` so the reviewer re-runs on the merged head
    -- the only safe pattern for PR-having worktrees, since a local-only
    merge commit would diverge local HEAD from `pr.head.sha` and break
    every downstream gate that compares the two. Works under both
    AUTO_MERGE on (replaces the unmergeable trigger) and AUTO_MERGE off
    (the only auto-rebase path under that mode -- `_handle_in_review`'s
    AUTO_MERGE-off path otherwise just sits in `in_review`).

    Skips the detour when:

    * The label is not one this refresh knows how to drive into
      `resolving_conflict` (only `validating` / `in_review`); the
      `resolving_conflict` label itself is also skipped because the
      handler runs this tick anyway and will do the merge regardless.

    * `awaiting_human=True`. `_handle_resolving_conflict`'s awaiting-human
      branch returns early without merging unless a new human comment
      arrived; relabeling here would just hide the existing park behind a
      `resolving_conflict` label without making any progress, including
      the documented `AUTO_MERGE=off` unmergeable park path. The park
      already invites the human to comment, and once they do, the existing
      handler's resume-on-human-reply branch picks the work up. Auto-
      unparking here would also undermine `_handle_validating`'s
      `MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS` / `_handle_resolving_conflict`'s
      `MAX_CONFLICT_ROUNDS` caps, which exist precisely to require human
      intervention after repeated failures.

    * The PR is no longer open. A merged PR advances `origin/<base>`, so
      the still-validating / still-in_review worktree pointed at the now-
      stale branch is naturally behind base; without this gate the detour
      would post an "auto-resolution" notice and relabel to
      `resolving_conflict` on a PR the next handler call would finalize to
      `done`. Same for closed-without-merge if base advanced concurrently
      (handler would finalize to `rejected`). Leave terminal PR state to
      the existing stage logic. A `gh.get_pr` failure is treated as
      "leave it alone" -- the handler can retry on the next tick from a
      stable label rather than racing a half-known PR state from refresh.

    The watermark bump in `_handle_in_review`'s analogous detour is
    deliberately NOT replicated here. That bump is safe in_review-side
    because `_handle_in_review` has already scanned new comments before
    the relabel (anything past the watermark has been consumed by the
    fix-loop or filtered as orchestrator-authored). The refresh-time
    detour runs BEFORE any handler scans comments, so `latest_comment_id`
    may include unread human "do not merge" / fix-request comments;
    advancing the watermark here would silently mark them consumed and
    later validation / merge would skip them. The orchestrator's own
    PR notice we just posted is filtered out via `orchestrator_comment_ids`
    on the next `_handle_in_review` scan, so leaving the watermark alone
    does not cause the orchestrator to "see" its own message as fresh
    feedback.

    Walk comments oldest-to-newest across both surfaces (issue thread and

    covers both). The pickup comment is the boundary: everything before
    `pickup_comment_id` is pre-pickup chatter the dev agent already saw at
    spawn, so it can be advanced past. From the pickup forward, advance
    through the contiguous run of orchestrator-authored comments AND
    through any ISSUE-THREAD comment with id <= `consumed_through` (already
    fed to the dev agent via a prior `_resume_developer_on_human_reply`
    call during implementing/validating), stopping at the first
    not-yet-consumed non-orchestrator comment. This preserves human
    feedback posted during validating that the dev has not yet seen while
    NOT replaying feedback the dev has already consumed.

    `consumed_through` is intentionally NOT applied to PR-conversation
    comments. `last_action_comment_id` only records issue-thread ids fed
    via `_resume_developer_on_human_reply` (validating/implementing watch
    the issue thread only); a PR-conversation comment whose id happens to
    be <= a later-consumed issue-thread reply has NOT been seen by the dev
    and must surface on the next in_review tick. Folding both surfaces
    under one `c.id <= consumed_through` check would let AUTO_MERGE land
    the PR over unread PR-conversation feedback.

    Identification of orchestrator-authored content is by exact comment id
    (recorded when the orchestrator posted the comment) rather than author
    login. The login-based check would also drop comments authored by a
    human reviewer who shares the PAT's GitHub account -- a common
    deployment shape -- causing real review feedback to be auto-merged over.

    Returns None when the pickup id is unknown (legacy state from a deploy
    that pre-dates pickup-id tracking, or a manually-relabeled issue) or
    when the surface has no orchestrator-authored content. The caller then
    defaults the watermark to 0 so the in_review legacy migration cannot
    advance past historical content; the orchestrator_comment_ids id-set
