"""Process-local scheduler for per-issue handlers.

The polling loop drives per-issue work concurrently across repos under a
global cap and a per-repo cap. This module owns the process-local
in-flight state and the executor that actually runs the work. It is a
plain library -- no GitHub or workflow imports -- so the tick loop can
hand work to it without importing the workflow facade.

API:

* ``submit(repo_slug, issue_number, fn, *, family=False, cap_exempt=False,
  per_repo_cap=None)``
  -- nonblocking. Returns True when a worker thread was dispatched, False
  when the call was skipped (duplicate active issue, global cap reached,
  per-repo cap reached, family slot already taken, or the scheduler has
  been shut down). ``cap_exempt=True`` skips the global and per-repo cap
  checks (and does not consume a cap slot) while still honoring the
  duplicate-active gate and the family mutex; used by no-agent family
  buckets and closed-issue terminal finalizations so a pure label /
  dep-graph walk or a cheap done/rejected flip never gets blocked by
  ordinary implementation work this tick.
* ``reap()`` -- nonblocking. Drains completed futures, logs any worker
  exception, returns the number of futures drained. Completion markers
  (in-flight set, per-repo counter, family flag) are cleared in the
  worker's done-callback, NOT here, so a follow-up ``submit`` for the
  same issue is unblocked the instant the worker exits even if ``reap``
  is never called. ``reap`` exists for failure logging and as an explicit
  drain hook for tests / shutdown.
* ``shutdown(*, wait=True)`` -- nonblocking submit path is closed first,
  then the executor is shut down and any leftover failures drained
  through ``reap``.
* ``track_active(repo_slug, issue_number)`` -- context manager that
  registers ``(repo, issue)`` in the in-flight set for the duration of
  the block without bumping the per-repo counter. The family-bucket
  drain in ``_dispatch_via_scheduler`` uses it so per-issue
  ``is_active`` checks (notably the pre-tick base refresh's worktree
  skip) keep working for the issue currently being processed inside
  the bucket task.

The in-flight set keys on ``(repo_slug, issue_number)``: an issue
already running in one repo does not block the same issue number in a
different repo. The family-aware gate (cross-issue writers like
``decomposing`` / ``blocked`` / ``umbrella``) is one shared slot per
repo, NOT per (repo, issue), so a single family worker on a repo blocks
every other family worker on that repo regardless of issue number while
still leaving non-family workers free to run.

Deliberately independent of ``global_cap``: cap-exempt work is by
definition not subject to ``MAX_PARALLEL_ISSUES_GLOBAL``, so sizing
this pool against the cap would silently re-impose it. A multi-repo
orchestrator can have one no-agent family bucket per repo plus a handful
of closed-issue terminal finalizations in flight at once, and those
handlers are short (label / dep-graph walk, or a done/rejected flip with
branch cleanup), so a fixed generous bound covers any realistic
deployment without spinning up unbounded threads. A rare burst past the
bound (e.g. many PRs merged at once) simply queues on this executor and
drains quickly -- still never blocked by cap-counted agent work.

        Used by the family-bucket drain in ``_dispatch_via_scheduler``: the
        bucket itself owns the family slot via the parent submit's
        ``family=True``, but the parent submit is keyed on a sentinel
        issue number, NOT on the issue currently being processed inside

        -- and ``_refresh_base_and_worktrees`` would race the agent by
        rebasing the worktree under the live worker.

        The marker lives in a SEPARATE set (``_tracked``) so it does NOT
        count toward the global cap (``len(self._active)``) or the
        per-repo counter. The bucket's parent submit already accounts

        ``_process_issue`` when ``claimed`` is False -- otherwise two
        workers could run the same issue handler concurrently. The
        bucket dispatch path classifies issues by a fresh label read on
        the tick thread, so within one tick this race is impossible;
        the guard catches the cross-tick window where tick N classified
        ``#X`` as fanout and submitted it, tick N+1 reclassified
        ``#X`` as family-aware (after a relabel) and folded it into the
        bucket, and the bucket reached ``#X`` before the fanout worker
        from tick N exited.
